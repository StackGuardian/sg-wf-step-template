## Contribution types

### Report Bugs

We use GitHub issues to track bugs. Please use the Bug report issue template when creating a new issue.

### Fix Bugs and implement features

All contributions to solve GitHub issues tagged with "bug", "enhancement" and "help wanted" are most welcome and greatly appreciated.

### Documentation

The Bicep Workflow Step could always use more documentation, whether as part of the
official documentation, in code comments, or even on the web in blog posts,
articles, and such.

### Submit Feedback

Please use GitHub Discussions to submit feedback and engage with the community.

## Basic guidelines

### Commits

-  Use the imperative, present tense (Â«changeÂ», not Â«changedÂ» or Â«changesÂ») to be consistent with generated messages from commands like git merge.
- Describe the changes you have made

#### Examples
**Good example**: 
 - Commit Message:\
  `Add parameter validation for Azure region input`

- Description:\
`Implement validation for Azure region parameter to ensure only valid regions are accepted. Update documentation to list supported regions.`

  Why it's Good:
    > **Clarity**: Clearly states the action and the feature.\
    >**Specificity**: Specifies what was implemented and what it affects.\
    >**Consistency**: Uses imperative, present tense, aligning with best practices.


**Bad Example**:  
- Commit Message:\
  `Fixed deployment stuff`
- Description:\
`Made changes to the deployment code. Updated some parameters.`
  Why it's Bad:
    > **Vague**: Does not explain what was fixed.\
    > **Lacks Detail**: Provides no insight into what changes were made.\
    > Does not use imperitive present tense.

### Pull Requests

- **Stay Updated**: Make sure your PR is based on the latest code from the `main` branch.
- **Clear Title and Description**: Try to include a clear, descriptive title and a detailed explanation of your changes.
- **Reference Issues**: If applicable, link to related issues and PRs.
- **Pass Tests**: Ensure all tests pass before submitting your PR.
- **Be Open to Feedback**: We're all here to help each other improve, so please be open to feedback and ready to make adjustments.

### Creating Issues

- **Search First**: It helps to check if your problem or feature request has already been discussed before opening a new issue.
- **Be Detailed**: When you open a new issue, providing as much detail as possible really helps. Feel free to use our templates for bugs and feature requests.
- **Be Respectful**: Let's all be kind and considerate in our communication.

### Solving Issues

- Limit yourself to solving a maximum of four `good first issues`. Once you've reached this limit, consider tackling other types of issues.
- Please work on only one issue at a time.
- Please ask for assignee before working, and if there's no update for about a week on a particular issue, we'll remove the assignee.

Thank you for taking the time to help improve our project!

### If you have commit access:

- Do NOT use git push --force.
- Do NOT commit to other contributor's branches without their consent.
- Use Pull Requests if you are unsure and to suggest changes to other maintainers.
